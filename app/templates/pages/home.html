# QueryR

**QueryR** is a REST compliant webservice for accessing information stored in
[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org).

It uses the free and open source
[QueryR API](https://github.com/JeroenDeDauw/QueryrAPI) software, which can
more generally be used to access [Wikibase](http://wikiba.se/) information.

You can find the API's root endpoint at [{{ api_url }}](http://{{ api_url }}).

## Stability

The QueryR service is still **in development**. **No guarantees** about its availability or stability are
provided. Do not rely on this service and **do not use it in production**.

At this point, we are looking for input and
[welcome your feedback](https://github.com/JeroenDeDauw/QueryrAPI/issues).

## Differences with the Wikidata web API

#### Scope

* Only retrieval of data, no write actions
* Only simple access, no queries

<small>At some point, adding writing actions and queries might be on the table, though this will then be
done by proxying the existing Wikidata API, SPARQL endpoint and similar services.</small>

#### Advantages

* REST API with resources, HTTP verbs and hypermedia controls ([Richardson Maturity Model](http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html) level 3)
    * More intuitive use
    * Decreased binding of your client to the API
    * Self-documenting
    * Standards compliant
* Use-case orientated approach rather than one-size-fits-all
    * Much simpler formats
    * Much more stable formats
    * Faster and cheaper to retrieve formats due to much smaller size
* Denormalization and inclusion of referenced data
    * No need to make additional requests to understand the requested data

#### Disadvantages

* As this API focuses on serving the most common use cases well, uncommon use cases (typically advanced ones), might not be served at all
* Not directly connected to the Wikidata persistence, so results might not be as fresh

<small>Note that these lists compare using a hypothetically finished initial version QueryR to better
illustrate the potential. As the development is still in early stages, advantages such as stability
have not yet been achieved and lack of proper hosting infrastructure and actual data replication
are more than disadvantageous.</small>

## Open questions

The open questions fall into several categories

1. What are the most common use cases and how are they each best served?
2. What are the best ways to expose certain general features such as versioning, language selection and rate limiting
3. How is all of this best implemented internally

Input on the first two points (what to build) is needed most, though you are also welcome to comment
on the third point (how to build it). Please comment on, or create new, issues on the issue tracker.

## Author and credits

The **QueryR software** has been created and is maintained by Jeroen De Dauw as hobby project.
It is **not maintained by Wikimedia** or Wikimedia Deutchland.

The **webservice** is run by Adam Shorland and Jeroen De Dauw and is similarly not a WMF/WMDE
backed project. It does however make use of Wikimedia Labs.

The **data exposed** by the webservice has been imported from the Wikidata project.

The QueryR API is **built on** various open source projects, including the
[Silex microframework](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/), several
[Wikibase libraries](http://wikiba.se/components/) and the
[Symfony HttpFoundation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation/introduction.html)
component.
